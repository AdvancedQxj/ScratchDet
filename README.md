The code is originally based on the [SSD-caffe](https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd) and [RefineDet-caffe](https://github.com/sfzhang15/RefineDet) framework. We also implement on [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). If you want to use one kind of codes, please follow their instructions to finish the initial install.

## Introduction

ScratchDet focus on training object detectors from scratch in order to tackle the problems caused by ﬁne-tuning from pretrained networks. In this paper, we study the effects of BatchNorm in the backbone and detection head subnetworks, and successfully train detectors from scratch. By taking the pretaining-free advantage, we are able to explore various architectures for detector designing. Please see our paper for more details.
